Mozilla implements support for missing functionalities in Firefox, they will be integrated in a future update of
New Tab Override.

  automatically be opened.

- [ENHANCEMENT] there is an upgrade notice for users of the legecy version of New Tab Override. This notice is not
  visible on fresh installs
- [CODE QUALITY] improved code quality and added more code documentation, use of ESLint, stylelint, htmllint and JSDoc

**Thanks to [Ura Design](https://ura.design/) for the new logo!**

  Override. It will be possible in future versions of Firefox again.

  file to a web server to use it again.
